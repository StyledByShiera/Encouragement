We face so many challenges in our life that sometimes make us or break us. It really depends on how we react to the situation. How we deal with it. How we accept it and how we train our brain on what to think from what not to think.¬†

It's so easy to give advice to other people on what they should do from what they shouldn't. But when it comes to ourselves, it's so freaking difficult. It's true, it's easier said than done.¬†

I don't know if this happened to you, but it did to me. I gave advice to a friend or a relative who is experiencing problems and they end up choosing the same dumb decisions opposite to what I just told them. I got so frustrated, It made me question their decision making and them as a person to the extent. But in reality, when we are the ones already experiencing the hardships. We made the same dumb mistakes, or at least some of us did. That's what we are when we are not guided properly.¬†

If we take on life alone, it would really be very difficult to bear. However, If we surrender everything to God, it miraculously lightens the load. It might not solve the problems right then and there but let's admit it, the burden was lifted from us and we somehow felt hope. All of a sudden we see a tiny glimpse of sunshine. That's how our God works in us. He doesn't need to give us direct advice, rather He just waits for us to let Him lead us. He shows the way. The right way that no one can provide.¬†

In today's world, there are times when I feel overwhelmed and lost. And even if there's a lot of motivational videos, podcasts, inspirational quotes and coaches out there. They fixed me for a little while, but they're just not enough. I'm still lost and don't know what to do with my life. It felt like I'm all alone struggling in this battle, like whatever I do it won't change anything. I'm stuck and miserable. I feel lonely and cry for no reason. I sometimes wanted to just disappear thinking that no one will ever care, really. This kept happening to me for so many years now.¬†

But honestly, these unfortunate moments were the ones that lead me to releasing everything and surrendering all to the Lord. I learned how to cope with it, that no matter what I do, I'm not the one in control. It's His will and only His plans will be fulfilled. The minute we start letting Him control our life and our choices, we start seeing amazing results. We start meeting the right people and doors of opportunities are now opening for us. Again, it's how we deal with the problem.¬†

Just remember, as a human it's normal for us to encounter setbacks. Small or big they are there to mold us to become better. We have to learn from past mistakes. May it be our mistakes or from others, one thing is clear, God is with us from start to finish. He's always there waiting patiently for us. So whenever you feel troubled, tired, and lost just reach out to Him, talk to Him, surrender everything and let Him lead the way. By His grace, everything will be okay. You‚Äôre gonna be okay.
